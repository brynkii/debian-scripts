# debian-scripts
- This is a simple repository for creating a debian desktop from scratch. It has been heavily inspired by drewgrif and the Linux dabbler. I recommend you go there for more debian themed content. For now the repo will mainly have xorg styled layout. I have still not experimented with wayland.
